# User description

**User type**: robotics end-user and robotics system integrator

**User domain**: Construction

**User Problem**:

*The users goal is to create a highly flexible production line. The elements manufactured on the envisioned line will be one of a kind. The manufacturing process requires multiple steps which consist of drilling into wood and plasterboard materials as well as assembly operations including peg in whole operations. The manufacturing data is not available as CAD data but as structured data that needs to be transformed into viable robot programs for each production step and element manufactured.*

**Targeted equipment**: 

*Industrial robot*



# Derived user stories

1. As the described user, I want to *drill holes of different sizes and shapes on a 2D surface with a robot based on a task description* so that I can *produce walls with individually placed holes.*
2. As the described user I want to *insert sockets into foreseen holes on a 2D surface with a robot based on a task description* so that I can *assemble sockets on a wall in an automated fashion.*





# Suggested technology

1. Task description language
2. Peg in hole assembly skill
