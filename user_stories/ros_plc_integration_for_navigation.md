# User description

**User type**: robotics equipment manufacturer

**User domain**: Manufacturing & Warehousing

**User Problem**:

*The users goal is to integrate a PLC with ROS for usage in mobile robots. The user wants to run ROS/ROS 2 on ARM and x86 platforms which the PLCs are based on, a ROS-based container would be running on the PLC itself. Interfaces for sharing odometry and other sensor data should be provided.*

**Targeted equipment**: 

*Mobile robots*



# Derived user stories

1. As the described user, I want to *run ROS on ARM and x86 platforms in docker containers* so that I can *easily deploy ROS to different kind of machines.*
2. As the described user I want to *share data between PLC and ROS* so that I can *run highlevel functions like navigation and task planning on ROS while low level functions like safety etc. run on the PLC.*



# Suggested technology

1. Real-time data exchange interface 
2. Container technology for ARM and x86
